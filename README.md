# UniStay-Rental-System
A console-based Rental Management System in C++ implementing DSA concepts including Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting and Searching Algorithms.

---

## Overview 
UniStay is a rental property management system that allows administrators and tenants to manage their rental units, tenant accounts, reservations, billing, and maintenance requests using a console application. The project serves as a practical application of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts learned throughout the course while following modular software design practices.

# Technologies Used:
- C++ 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
- Standard Template Library (STL) 
- File Handling 
- Git & GitHub

## Current Features

The following features are currently implemented in the UniStay Rental System.

### Authentication

* Administrator login
* Tenant login
* Tenant registration
* Authentication validation

### Property Management

* View all rental units
* Add new rental units
* Remove existing rental units

### Tenant Management

* View tenant information

### Data Persistence

The system automatically loads and saves data using CSV files.

Current data files include:

* `units.csv`
* `tenants.csv`
* `complaints.csv`
* `payments.csv`
* `bookings.csv`
* `guardians.csv`

# How to Build and Run

## Requirements

Before compiling make sure the following are installed:

* MinGW g++
* Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell

Verify your compiler by running:

```bash
g++ --version
```

---

## Build

The recommended way to build the project is by using the provided build script.

```bash
build.bat
```

Alternatively, compile manually:

```bash
g++ src/main.cpp src/authentication/Login.cpp src/property/Unit.cpp src/maintenance/Complaint.cpp src/users/Admin.cpp src/users/Tenant.cpp src/dsa/Sorting.cpp -o unistay.exe
```

---

## Run

After compiling successfully:

```bash
unistay.exe
```

Or just run **build.bat** to auto compile and launch the prorgam.
